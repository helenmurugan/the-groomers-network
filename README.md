The Groomer's Network is a professional networking site that allows pet groomers to network and access information about upcoming events. It has a login system and allows users to set up a profile. Authenticated users can create, read, update and delete their own posts and comments, as well as read and comment on other user's posts. 
In the real world, pet groomers use private Facebook groups to network and promote their events. The Groomer's Network provides a dedicated setting that encourages a professional approach to networking.
