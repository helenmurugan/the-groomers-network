## About

The Groomer's Network is a professional networking site that allows pet groomers to network with their peers and access information about upcoming events. It has a login system and allows users to set up a profile. Authenticated users can create, read, update and delete their own posts and events, as well as read and comment on other user's posts and events. 
In the real world, pet groomers use private Facebook groups to network and promote their events. The groups can be very difficult to manage 

however, The Groomer's Network provides a dedicated setting that encourages a more professional approach to networking.
